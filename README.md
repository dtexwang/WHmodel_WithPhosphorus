# WHmodel_WithPhosphorus
Data and code for an extended version of the [Wing and Halevy (2014)](http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1407502111) model of S-isotope fractionation during microbial sulfate reduction.  

The relevant portions of Wing and Halevy's model and our modifications to it are described in Zaarur et al. (2017) _Front. Microbiol._, "Influence of phosphorus and cell geometry on the fractionation of sulfur isotopes by several species of _Desulfovibrio_ during microbial sulfate reduction" (doi: [10.3389/fmicb.2017.00890](http://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00890)).  

The code produces draft-quality versions of Figures 7 and A3, and a version of Figure A4.  I also put the published versions of these figures in this repo - they're located in the directory called `final figures`.
